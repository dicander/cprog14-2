* Getting started with Kattis, see the Kattis Catalogue
    different.cpp and different2.cpp
    both solve the kattis problem different in different ways.
    explain both approaches in detail.
    Consider submitting them to Kattis.
    In the Kattis folder there is also a file with the programming contest C++ template. It's good to show why these
    are good for contests but bad for labs and industry programming.

* Construction and destruction
    Explain Rule Of Three (or five).
    Show how default constructors can be deleted and explain the behaviour.
    explain with boxes and arrows diagrams how arrays and variables get allocated and run on the stack and heap.
    Destruction: Show with valgrind or the compiler flag -fsanitize=leak,undefined,address what happens if you
    try to delete null. Also show if they work despite the errors.

* Namespaces
    Using directives. What namespaces are good for.

* Polymorphism of C++.
    Ad hoc polymorphism:
        functions: Show that in C++ you can have overloaded functions (same name, different set of parameters)
        operators: Show at least one example of operator overloading.
    Subtyping polymorphism
        Coming this week on the lectures, inheritance and virtual, but explain the difference between override and overload
        (överskuggning och överlagring)
    Parametric polymorphism
        Templates, coming later, but a few examples included
